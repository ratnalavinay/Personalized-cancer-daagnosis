0||Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes. CDK10 stands out as one of the last orphan CDKs for which no activating cyclin has been identified and no kinase activity revealed. Previous work has shown that CDK10 silencing increases ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2)-driven activation of the MAPK pathway, which confers tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. The precise mechanisms by which CDK10 modulates ETS2 activity, and more generally the functions of CDK10, remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase by identifying cyclin M as an activating cyclin. Cyclin M, an orphan cyclin, is the product of FAM58A, whose mutations cause STAR syndrome, a human developmental anomaly whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations. We show that STAR syndrome-associated cyclin M mutants are unable to interact with CDK10. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. CDK10/cyclin M phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro, and in cells it positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. ETS2 protein levels are increased in cells derived from a STAR patient, and this increase is attributable to decreased cyclin M levels. Altogether, our results reveal an additional regulatory mechanism for ETS2, which plays key roles in cancer and development. They also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes (1). The human genome contains 21 genes encoding proteins that can be considered as members of the CDK family owing to their sequence similarity with bona fide CDKs, those known to be activated by cyclins (2). Although discovered almost 20 y ago (3, 4), CDK10 remains one of the two CDKs without an identified cyclin partner. This knowledge gap has largely impeded the exploration of its biological functions. CDK10 can act as a positive cell cycle regulator in some cells (5, 6) or as a tumor suppressor in others (7, 8). CDK10 interacts with the ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) transcription factor and inhibits its transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (9). CDK10 knockdown derepresses ETS2, which increases the expression of the c-Raf protein kinase, activates the MAPK pathway, and induces resistance of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (6).Here, we deorphanize CDK10 by identifying cyclin M, the product of FAM58A, as a binding partner. Mutations in this gene that predict absence or truncation of cyclin M are associated with STAR syndrome, whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations in heterozygous females (10). However, both the functions of cyclin M and the pathogenesis of STAR syndrome remain unknown. We show that a recombinant CDK10/cyclin M heterodimer is an active protein kinase that phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and phospho-ERK expression levels and in inducing tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells. We show that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome, through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines. Finally, we detect an increased ETS2 expression level in cells derived from a STAR patient, and we demonstrate that it is attributable to the decreased cyclin M expression level observed in these cells.Previous SectionNext SectionResultsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen unveiled an interaction signal between CDK10 and a mouse protein whose C-terminal half presents a strong sequence homology with the human FAM58A gene product [whose proposed name is cyclin M (11)]. We thus performed Y2H mating assays to determine whether human CDK10 interacts with human cyclin M (Fig. 1 A–C). The longest CDK10 isoform (P1) expressed as a bait protein produced a strong interaction phenotype with full-length cyclin M (expressed as a prey protein) but no detectable phenotype with cyclin D1, p21 (CIP1), and Cdi1 (KAP), which are known binding partners of other CDKs (Fig. 1B). CDK1 and CDK3 also produced Y2H signals with cyclin M, albeit notably weaker than that observed with CDK10 (Fig. 1B). An interaction phenotype was also observed between full-length cyclin M and CDK10 proteins expressed as bait and prey, respectively (Fig. S1A). We then tested different isoforms of CDK10 and cyclin M originating from alternative gene splicing, and two truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two mutated FAM58A genes found in STAR syndrome patients (10). None of these shorter isoforms produced interaction phenotypes (Fig. 1 A and C and Fig. S1A).Fig. 1.In a new window Download PPTFig. 1.CDK10 and cyclin M form an interaction complex. (A) Schematic representation of the different protein isoforms analyzed by Y2H assays. Amino acid numbers are indicated. Black boxes indicate internal deletions. The red box indicates a differing amino acid sequence compared with CDK10 P1. (B) Y2H assay between a set of CDK proteins expressed as baits (in fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain) and CDK interacting proteins expressed as preys (in fusion to the B42 transcriptional activator). pEG202 and pJG4-5 are the empty bait and prey plasmids expressing LexA and B42, respectively. lacZ was used as a reporter gene, and blue yeast are indicative of a Y2H interaction phenotype. (C) Y2H assay between the different CDK10 and cyclin M isoforms. The amino-terminal region of ETS2, known to interact with CDK10 (9), was also assayed. (D) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells. (E) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Myc antibody. “Inputs” correspond to 10 μg total lysates obtained from HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His. (F) Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-CDK10 antibody or a control goat antibody, from human breast cancer MCF7 cells. “Input” corresponds to 30 μg MCF7 total cell lysates. The lower band of the doublet observed on the upper panel comigrates with the exogenously expressed untagged CDK10 and thus corresponds to endogenous CDK10. The upper band of the doublet corresponds to a nonspecific signal, as demonstrated by it insensitivity to either overexpression of CDK10 (as seen on the left lane) or silencing of CDK10 (Fig. S2B). Another experiment with a longer gel migration is shown in Fig. S1D.Next we examined the ability of CDK10 and cyclin M to interact when expressed in human cells (Fig. 1 D and E). We tested wild-type CDK10 (wt) and a kinase dead (kd) mutant bearing a D181A amino acid substitution that abolishes ATP binding (12). We expressed cyclin M-V5-6His and/or Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). The expression level of cyclin M-V5-6His was significantly increased upon coexpression with Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and, to a lesser extent, that of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) was increased upon coexpression with cyclin M-V5-6His (Fig. 1D). We then immunoprecipitated Myc-CDK10 proteins and detected the presence of cyclin M in the CDK10 (wt) and (kd) immunoprecipitates only when these proteins were coexpressed pair-wise (Fig. 1E). We confirmed these observations by detecting the presence of Myc-CDK10 in cyclin M-V5-6His immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). These experiments confirmed the lack of robust interaction between the CDK10.P2 isoform and cyclin M (Fig. S1C). To detect the interaction between endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitations on nontransfected MCF7 cells derived from a human breast cancer. CDK10 and cyclin M antibodies detected their cognate endogenous proteins by Western blotting. We readily detected cyclin M in immunoprecipitates obtained with the CDK10 antibody but not with a control antibody (Fig. 1F). These results confirm the physical interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M in human cells.To unveil a hypothesized CDK10/cyclin M protein kinase activity, we produced GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M fusion proteins in insect cells, either individually or in combination. We observed that GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M copurified, thus confirming their interaction in yet another cellular model (Fig. 2A). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins, using histone H1 as a generic substrate. Histone H1 phosphorylation was detected only from lysates of cells coexpressing GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M. No phosphorylation was detected when GST-CDK10 or StrepII-cyclin M were expressed alone, or when StrepII-cyclin M was coexpressed with GST-CDK10(kd) (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether ETS2, which is known to interact with CDK10 (9) (Fig. 1C), is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M. We detected strong phosphorylation of ETS2 by the GST-CDK10/StrepII-cyclin M purified heterodimer, whereas no phosphorylation was detected using GST-CDK10 alone or GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-cyclin M heterodimer (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.In a new window Download PPTFig. 2.CDK10 is a cyclin M-dependent protein kinase. (A) In vitro protein kinase assay on histone H1. Lysates from insect cells expressing different proteins were purified on a glutathione Sepharose matrix to capture GST-CDK10(wt or kd) fusion proteins alone, or in complex with STR-CycM fusion protein. Purified protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blots (Top and Upper Middle). The kinase activity was determined by autoradiography of histone H1, whose added amounts were visualized by Coomassie staining (Lower Middle and Bottom). (B) Same as in A, using purified recombinant 6His-ETS2 as a substrate.CDK10 silencing has been shown to increase ETS2-driven c-RAF transcription and to activate the MAPK pathway (6). We investigated whether cyclin M is also involved in this regulatory pathway. To aim at a highly specific silencing, we used siRNA pools (mix of four different siRNAs) at low final concentration (10 nM). Both CDK10 and cyclin M siRNA pools silenced the expression of their cognate targets (Fig. 3 A and C and Fig. S2) and, interestingly, the cyclin M siRNA pool also caused a marked decrease in CDK10 protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These results, and those shown in Fig. 1D, suggest that cyclin M binding stabilizes CDK10. Cyclin M silencing induced an increase in c-Raf protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B and C) and in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 protein levels (Fig. S3B), similarly to CDK10 silencing. As expected from these effects (6), CDK10 and cyclin M silencing both decreased the sensitivity of ER+ MCF7 cells to tamoxifen, to a similar extent. The combined silencing of both genes did not result in a higher resistance to the drug (Fig. S3C). Altogether, these observations demonstrate a functional interaction between cyclin M and CDK10, which negatively controls ETS2.Fig. 3.In a new window Download PPTFig. 3.Cyclin M silencing up-regulates c-Raf expression.

ETS2 is a short-lived protein degraded by the proteasome (13). A straightforward hypothesis is that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation. We thus examined the impact of CDK10 or cyclin M silencing on ETS2 expression levels. The silencing of CDK10 and that of cyclin M caused an increase in the expression levels of an exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein (Fig. S4A), as well as of the endogenous ETS2 protein (Fig. 4A). This increase is not attributable to increased ETS2 mRNA levels, which marginally fluctuated in response to CDK10 or cyclin M silencing (Fig. S4B). We then examined the expression levels of the Flag-tagged ETS2 protein when expressed alone or in combination with Myc-CDK10 or -CDK10(kd), with or without cyclin M-V5-6His. Flag-ETS2 was readily detected when expressed alone or, to a lesser extent, when coexpressed with CDK10(kd). However, its expression level was dramatically decreased when coexpressed with CDK10 alone, or with CDK10 and cyclin M (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that endogenous cyclin M levels are in excess compared with those of CDK10 in MCF7 cells, and they show that the major decrease in ETS2 levels observed upon CDK10 coexpression involves CDK10 kinase activity. Treatment of cells coexpressing Flag-ETS2, CDK10, and cyclin M with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely rescued Flag-ETS2 expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4.In a new window Download PPTFig. 4.CDK10/cyclin M controls ETS2 stability in human cancer derived cells.

(B) Western blot analysis of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein levels in MCF7 cells cotransfected with empty vectors or coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd), or Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His. The latter cells were treated for 16 h with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor. Proper expression of CDK10 and cyclin M tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. (C and D) Western blot analysis of expression levels of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 wild-type or mutant proteins in MCF7 cells, in the absence of (C) or in response to (D) Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His expression. Quantifications are shown in Fig. S4 C and D.A mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ETS2 phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M in vitro revealed the existence of multiple phosphorylated residues, among which are two neighboring phospho-serines (at positions 220 and 225) that may form a phosphodegron (14) (Figs. S5–S8). To confirm this finding, we compared the phosphorylation level of recombinant ETS2wt with that of ETS2SASA protein, a mutant bearing alanine substitutions of these two serines. As expected from the existence of multiple phosphorylation sites, we detected a small but reproducible, significant decrease of phosphorylation level of ETS2SASA compared with ETS2wt (Fig. S9), thus confirming that Ser220/Ser225 are phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M. To establish a direct link between ETS2 phosphorylation by CDK10/cyclin M and degradation, we examined the expression levels of Flag-ETS2SASA. In the absence of CDK10/cyclin M coexpression, it did not differ significantly from that of Flag-ETS2. This is contrary to that of Flag-ETS2DBM, bearing a deletion of the N-terminal destruction (D-) box that was previously shown to be involved in APC-Cdh1–mediated degradation of ETS2 (13) (Fig. 4C). However, contrary to Flag-ETS2 wild type, the expression level of Flag-ETS2SASA remained insensitive to CDK10/cyclin M coexpression (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these results suggest that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of these two serines.Finally, we studied a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with STAR syndrome, bearing FAM58A mutation c.555+1G>A, predicted to result in aberrant splicing (10). In accordance with incomplete skewing of X chromosome inactivation previously found in this patient, we detected a decreased expression level of cyclin M protein in the STAR cell line, compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line. In line with our preceding observations, we detected an increased expression level of ETS2 protein in the STAR cell line compared with the control (Fig. 5A and Fig. S10A). We then examined by quantitative RT-PCR the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes. The STAR cell line showed a decreased expression level of cyclin M mRNA but an expression level of ETS2 mRNA similar to that of the control cell line (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the increase in ETS2 protein expression is indeed a result of the decreased cyclin M expression observed in the STAR patient-derived cell line, we expressed cyclin M-V5-6His in this cell line. This expression caused a decrease in ETS2 protein levels (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5.In a new window Download PPTFig. 5.Decreased cyclin M expression in STAR patient-derived cells results in increased ETS2 protein level.

Another Western blot revealing endogenously and exogenously expressed cyclin M levels is shown in Fig. S10B. A quantification of ETS2 protein levels is shown in Fig. S10C.Previous SectionNext SectionDiscussionIn this work, we unveil the interaction between CDK10, the last orphan CDK discovered in the pregenomic era (2), and cyclin M, the only cyclin associated with a human genetic disease so far, and whose functions remain unknown (10). The closest paralogs of CDK10 within the CDK family are the CDK11 proteins, which interact with L-type cyclins (15). Interestingly, the closest paralog of these cyclins within the cyclin family is cyclin M (Fig. S11). The fact that none of the shorter CDK10 isoforms interact robustly with cyclin M suggests that alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene (16, 17) plays an important role in regulating CDK10 functions.The functional relevance of the interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M is supported by different observations. Both proteins seem to enhance each other’s stability, as judged from their increased expression levels when their partner is exogenously coexpressed (Fig. 1D) and from the much reduced endogenous CDK10 expression level observed in response to cyclin M silencing (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). CDK10 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18). Our observations suggest that cyclin M protects CDK10 from such degradation and that it is the only cyclin partner of CDK10, at least in MCF7 cells. They also suggest that cyclin M stability is enhanced upon binding to CDK10, independently from its kinase activity, as seen for cyclin C and CDK8 (19). We uncover a cyclin M-dependent CDK10 protein kinase activity in vitro, thus demonstrating that this protein, which was named a CDK on the sole basis of its amino acid sequence, is indeed a genuine cyclin-dependent kinase. Our Y2H assays reveal that truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two STAR syndrome-associated FAM58A mutations do not produce an interaction phenotype with CDK10. Hence, regardless of whether these mutated mRNAs undergo nonsense-mediated decay (as suggested from the decreased cyclin M mRNA levels in STAR cells, shown in Fig. 5B) or give rise to truncated cyclin M proteins, females affected by the STAR syndrome must exhibit compromised CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity at least in some tissues and during specific developmental stages.We show that ETS2, a known interactor of CDK10, is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M in vitro and that CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. This control seems to be exerted through a very fine mechanism, as judged from the sensitivity of ETS2 levels to partially decreased CDK10 and cyclin M levels, achieved in MCF7 cells and observed in STAR cells, respectively. These findings offer a straightforward explanation for the already reported up-regulation of ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF in response to CDK10 silencing (6). We bring evidence that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines, which may form a noncanonical β-TRCP phosphodegron (DSMCPAS) (14). Because none of these two serines precede a proline, they do not conform to usual CDK phosphorylation sites. However, multiple so-called transcriptional CDKs (CDK7, -8, -9, and -11) (to which CDK10 may belong; Fig. S11) have been shown to phosphorylate a variety of motifs in a non–proline-directed fashion, especially in the context of molecular docking with the substrate (20). Here, it can be hypothesized that the high-affinity interaction between CDK10 and the Pointed domain of ETS2 (6, 9) (Fig. 1C) would allow docking-mediated phosphorylation of atypical sites. The control of ETS2 degradation involves a number of players, including APC-Cdh1 (13) and the cullin-RING ligase CRL4 (21). The formal identification of the ubiquitin ligase involved in the CDK10/cyclin M pathway and the elucidation of its concerted action with the other ubiquitin ligases to regulate ETS2 degradation will require further studies.Our results present a number of significant biological and medical implications. First, they shed light on the regulation of ETS2, which plays an important role in development (22) and is frequently deregulated in many cancers (23). Second, our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing tamoxifen resistance associated with reduced CDK10 expression levels, and they suggest that, like CDK10 (6), cyclin M could also be a predictive clinical marker of hormone therapy response of ERα-positive breast cancer patients. Third, our findings offer an interesting hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome. Ets2 transgenic mice showing a less than twofold overexpression of Ets2 present severe cranial abnormalities (24), and those observed in STAR patients could thus be caused at least in part by increased ETS2 protein levels. Another expected consequence of enhanced ETS2 expression levels would be a decreased risk to develop certain types of cancers and an increased risk to develop others. Studies on various mouse models (including models of Down syndrome, in which three copies of ETS2 exist) have revealed that ETS2 dosage can repress or promote tumor growth and, hence, that ETS2 exerts noncell autonomous functions in cancer (25). Intringuingly, one of the very few STAR patients identified so far has been diagnosed with a nephroblastoma (26). Finally, our findings will facilitate the general exploration of the biological functions of CDK10 and, in particular, its role in the control of cell division. Previous studies have suggested either a positive role in cell cycle control (5, 6) or a tumor-suppressive activity in some cancers (7, 8). The severe growth retardation exhibited by STAR patients strongly suggests that CDK10/cyclin M plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation.Previous SectionNext SectionMaterials and MethodsCloning of CDK10 and cyclin M cDNAs, plasmid constructions, tamoxifen response analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, mass spectrometry experiments, and antibody production are detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assays. We performed yeast interaction mating assays as previously described (27).Mammalian Cell Cultures and Transfections. We grew human HEK293 and MCF7 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen), and we grew lymphoblastoid cells in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS. We transfected HEK293 and MCF7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmids, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs, and Jetprime (Polyplus) for plasmids/siRNAs combinations according to the manufacturers’ instructions. We transfected lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation (Neon, Invitrogen). For ETS2 stability studies we treated MCF7 cells 32 h after transfection with 10 μM MG132 (Fisher Scientific) for 16 h.Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Experiments. We collected cells by scraping in PBS (or centrifugation for lymphoblastoid cells) and lysed them by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 60 mM β-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops) (pH 7.2), 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1mM phenylphosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We spun the lysates 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, collected the supernatants, and determined the protein content using a Bradford assay. We performed the immunoprecipitation experiments on 500 μg of total proteins, in lysis buffer. We precleared the lysates with 20 μL of protein A or G-agarose beads, incubated 1 h 4 °C on a rotating wheel. We added 5 μg of antibody to the supernatants, incubated 1 h 4 °C on a rotating wheel, added 20 μL of protein A or G-agarose beads, and incubated 1 h 4 °C on a rotating wheel. We collected the beads by centrifugation 30 s at 18,000 × g at 4 °C and washed three times in a bead buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaF, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor coktail (Roche). We directly added sample buffer to the washed pellets, heat-denatured the proteins, and ran the samples on 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We transferred the proteins onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes and processed the blots according to standard procedures. For Western blot experiments, we used the following primary antibodies: anti-Myc (Abcam ab9106, 1:2,000), anti-V5 (Invitrogen R960, 1:5,000), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-7, 1:500), anti-CDK10 (Covalab pab0847p, 1:500 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19, 1:500), anti-CycM (home-made, dilution 1:500 or Covalab pab0882-P, dilution 1:500), anti-Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-ETS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma F7425, 1:1,000), and anti-actin (Sigma A5060, 1:5,000). We used HRP-coupled anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-2033, dilution 1:2,000), anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 170–6516, dilution 1:3,000) or anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad 172–1019, 1:5,000) as secondary antibodies. We revealed the blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Scientific).Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins.GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-CycM. We generated recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac Escherichia coli and baculoviruses in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system, as described by the provider (Invitrogen). We infected Sf9 cells with GST-CDK10- (or GST-CDK10kd)-producing viruses, or coinfected the cells with StrepII-CycM–producing viruses, and we collected the cells 72 h after infection. To purify GST-fusion proteins, we spun 250 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 40 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 0.3 mM Na-vanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We lysed the cells by sonication, spun the lysate 30 min at 15,000 × g, collected the soluble fraction, and added it to a 1-mL glutathione-Sepharose matrix. We incubated 1 h at 4 °C, washed four times with lysis buffer, one time with kinase buffer A (see below), and finally resuspended the beads in 100 μL kinase buffer A containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol for storage.6His-ETS2. We transformed Origami2 DE3 (Novagen) with the 6His-ETS2 expression vector. We induced expression with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 °C. To purify 6His-ETS2, we spun 50 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 2 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche). We lysed the cells at 1.6 bar using a cell disruptor and spun the lysate 10 min at 20,000 × g. We collected the soluble fraction and added it to 200 μL Cobalt beads (Thermo Scientific). After 1 h incubation at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, we washed four times with lysis buffer. To elute, we incubated beads 30 min with elution buffer (PBS, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitor mixture, spun 30 s at 10,000 × g, and collected the eluted protein.Protein Kinase Assays. We mixed glutathione-Sepharose beads (harboring GST-CDK10 wt or kd, either monomeric or complexed with StrepII-CycM), 22.7 μM BSA, 15 mM DTT, 100 μM ATP, 5 μCi ATP[γ-32P], 7.75 μM histone H1, or 1 μM 6His-ETS2 and added kinase buffer A (25 mM Tris·HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 3.7 μM heparin, pH 7.5) up to a total volume of 30 μL. We incubated the reactions 30 min at 30 °C, added Laemli sample buffer, heat-denatured the samples, and ran 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We cut gel slices to detect GST-CDK10 and StrepII-CycM by Western blotting. We stained the gel slices containing the substrate with Coomassie (R-250, Bio-Rad), dried them, and detected the incorporated radioactivity by autoradiography. We identified four unrelated girls with anogenital and renal malformations, dysmorphic facial features, normal intellect and syndactyly of toes. A similar combination of features had been reported previously in a mother–daughter pair1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Note online). These authors noted clinical overlap with Townes-Brocks syndrome but suggested that the phenotype represented a separate autosomal dominant entity (MIM601446). Here we define the cardinal features of this syndrome as a characteristic facial appearance with apparent telecanthus and broad tripartite nasal tip, variable syndactyly of toes 2–5, hypoplastic labia, anal atresia and urogenital malformations (Fig. 1a–h). We also observed a variety of other features (Table 1).  Figure 1: Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome.  Figure 1 : Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome. (a–f) Facial appearances of cases 1–3 (apparent telecanthus, dysplastic ears and thin upper lips; a,c,e), and toe syndactyly 2–5, 3–5 or 4–5 (b,d,f) in these cases illustrate recognizable features of STAR syndrome (specific parental consent has been obtained for publication of these photographs). Anal atresia and hypoplastic labia are not shown.

Log2 ratio represents copy number loss of six probes spanning between 37.9 and 50.7 kb, with one probe positioned within FAM58A. The deletion does not remove parts of other functional genes. (j) Schematic structure of FAM58A and position of the mutations. FAM58A has five coding exons (boxes). The cyclin domain (green) is encoded by exons 2–4. The horizontal arrow indicates the deletion extending 5' in case 1, which includes exons 1 and 2, whereas the horizontal line below exon 5 indicates the deletion found in case 3, which removes exon 5 and some 3' sequence. The pink horizontal bars above the boxes indicate the amplicons used for qPCR and sequencing (one alternative exon 5 amplicon is not indicated because of space constraints). The mutation 201dupT (case 4) results in an immediate stop codon, and the 555+1G>A and 555-1G>A splice mutations in cases 2, 5 and 6 are predicted to be deleterious because they alter the conserved splice donor and acceptor site of intron 4, respectively.  Full size image (97 KB)  Table 1: Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Table 1 - Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Full table  On the basis of the phenotypic overlap with Townes-Brocks, Okihiro and Feingold syndromes, we analyzed SALL1 (ref. 2), SALL4 (ref. 3) and MYCN4 but found no mutations in any of these genes (Supplementary Methods online). Next, we carried out genome-wide high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)5 analysis (Supplementary Methods) of genomic DNA from the most severely affected individual (case 1, with lower lid coloboma, epilepsy and syringomyelia) and identified a heterozygous deletion of 37.9–50.7 kb on Xq28, which removed exons 1 and 2 of FAM58A (Fig. 1i,j). Using real-time PCR, we confirmed the deletion in the child and excluded it in her unaffected parents (Supplementary Fig. 1a online, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online). Through CGH with a customized oligonucleotide array enriched in probes for Xq28, followed by breakpoint cloning, we defined the exact deletion size as 40,068 bp (g.152,514,164_152,554,231del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3 online). The deletion removes the coding regions of exons 1 and 2 as well as intron 1 (2,774 bp), 492 bp of intron 2, and 36,608 bp of 5' sequence, including the 5' UTR and the entire KRT18P48 pseudogene (NCBI gene ID 340598). Paternity was proven using routine methods. We did not find deletions overlapping FAM58A in the available copy number variation (CNV) databases.  Subsequently, we carried out qPCR analysis of the three other affected individuals (cases 2, 3 and 4) and the mother-daughter pair from the literature (cases 5 and 6). In case 3, we detected a de novo heterozygous deletion of 1.1–10.3 kb overlapping exon 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). Using Xq28-targeted array CGH and breakpoint cloning, we identified a deletion of 4,249 bp (g.152,504,123_152,508,371del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3), which removed 1,265 bp of intron 4, all of exon 5, including the 3' UTR, and 2,454 bp of 3' sequence.  We found heterozygous FAM58A point mutations in the remaining cases (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). In case 2, we identified the mutation 555+1G>A, affecting the splice donor site of intron 4. In case 4, we identified the frameshift mutation 201dupT, which immediately results in a premature stop codon N68XfsX1. In cases 5 and 6, we detected the mutation 556-1G>A, which alters the splice acceptor site of intron 4. We validated the point mutations and deletions by independent rounds of PCR and sequencing or by qPCR. We confirmed paternity and de novo status of the point mutations and deletions in all sporadic cases. None of the mutations were seen in the DNA of 60 unaffected female controls, and no larger deletions involving FAM58A were found in 93 unrelated array-CGH investigations.  By analyzing X-chromosome inactivation (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 online), we found complete skewing of X inactivation in cases 1 and 3–6 and almost complete skewing in case 2, suggesting that cells carrying the mutation on the active X chromosome have a growth disadvantage during fetal development. Using RT-PCR on RNA from lymphoblastoid cells of case 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we did not find any aberrant splice products as additional evidence that the mutated allele is inactivated. Furthermore, FAM58A is subjected to X inactivation6. In cases 1 and 3, the parental origin of the deletions could not be determined, as a result of lack of informative SNPs. Case 5, the mother of case 6, gave birth to two boys, both clinically unaffected (samples not available). We cannot exclude that the condition is lethal in males. No fetal losses were reported from any of the families.  The function of FAM58A is unknown. The gene consists of five coding exons, and the 642-bp coding region encodes a protein of 214 amino acids. GenBank lists a mRNA length of 1,257 bp for the reference sequence (NM_152274.2). Expression of the gene (by EST data) was found in 27 of 48 adult tissues including kidney, colon, cervix and uterus, but not heart (NCBI expression viewer, UniGene Hs.496943). Expression was also noted in 24 of 26 listed tumor tissues as well as in embryo and fetus. Genes homologous to FAM58A (NCBI HomoloGene: 13362) are found on the X chromosome in the chimpanzee and the dog. The zebrafish has a similar gene on chromosome 23. However, in the mouse and rat, there are no true homologs. These species have similar but intronless genes on chromosomes 11 (mouse) and 10 (rat), most likely arising from a retrotransposon insertion event. On the murine X chromosome, the flanking genes Atp2b3 and Dusp9 are conserved, but only remnants of the FAM58A sequence can be detected.  FAM58A contains a cyclin-box-fold domain, a protein-binding domain found in cyclins with a role in cell cycle and transcription control. No human phenotype resulting from a cyclin gene mutation has yet been reported. Homozygous knockout mice for Ccnd1 (encoding cyclin D1) are viable but small and have reduced lifespan. They also have dystrophic changes of the retina, likely as a result of decreased cell proliferation and degeneration of photoreceptor cells during embryogenesis7, 8.  Cyclin D1 colocalizes with SALL4 in the nucleus, and both proteins cooperatively mediate transcriptional repression9. As the phenotype of our cases overlaps considerably with that of Townes-Brocks syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations1, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation to find out if SALL1 or SALL4 would interact with FAM58A in a manner similar to that observed for SALL4 and cyclin D1. We found that FAM58A interacts with SALL1 but not with SALL4 (Supplementary Fig. 5 online), supporting the hypothesis that FAM58A and SALL1 participate in the same developmental pathway.  How do FAM58A mutations lead to STAR syndrome? Growth retardation (all cases; Table 1) and retinal abnormalities (three cases) are reminiscent of the reduced body size and retinal anomalies in cyclin D1 knockout mice7, 8. Therefore, a proliferation defect might be partly responsible for STAR syndrome. To address this question, we carried out a knockdown of FAM58A mRNA followed by a proliferation assay. Transfection of HEK293 cells with three different FAM58A-specific RNAi oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction of both FAM58A mRNA expression and proliferation of transfected cells (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 online), supporting the link between FAM58A and cell proliferation.  We found that loss-of-function mutations of FAM58A result in a rather homogeneous clinical phenotype. The additional anomalies in case 1 are likely to result from an effect of the 40-kb deletion on expression of a neighboring gene, possibly ATP2B3 or DUSP9. However, we cannot exclude that the homogeneous phenotype results from an ascertainment bias and that FAM58A mutations, including missense changes, could result in a broader spectrum of malformations. The genes causing the overlapping phenotypes of STAR syndrome and Townes-Brocks syndrome seem to act in the same pathway. Of note, MYCN, a gene mutated in Feingold syndrome, is a direct regulator of cyclin D2 (refs. 10,11); thus, it is worth exploring whether the phenotypic similarities between Feingold and STAR syndrome might be explained by direct regulation of FAM58A by MYCN.  FAM58A is located approximately 0.56 Mb centromeric to MECP2 on Xq28. Duplications overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been described and are not associated with a clinical phenotype in females12, but no deletions overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been observed to date13. Although other genes between FAM58A and MECP2 have been implicated in brain development, FAM58A and MECP2 are the only genes in this region known to result in X-linked dominant phenotypes; thus, deletion of both genes on the same allele might be lethal in both males and females. 
1|| Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, n = 8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5′-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3′ for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5′-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3′ for Q249E, and 5′-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3′ for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5′ end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 µL that contained 1 µL genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 0.5 µM of each primer (1.0 µM total for each primer pair), 400 µM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was ≤0.5 or ≥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight µg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1×105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 µg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1× PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 µg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1∶5000; c-MET, 1∶5000; EGFR, 1∶5000; ubiquitin, 1∶1000; HA, 1∶5000 and β-actin, 1∶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2×106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 µg/mL propidium iodide, 200 µg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 µg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 µg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 µg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (n = 50), African-Americans (n = 29), and Taiwanese (n = 40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (n = 37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (p = 0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (p = 0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (p = 0.022, p = 0.049, and p = 0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (p = 0.64, p = 0.40, and p = 0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (p = 0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (n = 29) and Caucasian (n = 50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis. 
2|| Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, n = 8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5′-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3′ for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5′-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3′ for Q249E, and 5′-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3′ for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5′ end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 µL that contained 1 µL genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 0.5 µM of each primer (1.0 µM total for each primer pair), 400 µM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was ≤0.5 or ≥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight µg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1×105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 µg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1× PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 µg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1∶5000; c-MET, 1∶5000; EGFR, 1∶5000; ubiquitin, 1∶1000; HA, 1∶5000 and β-actin, 1∶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2×106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 µg/mL propidium iodide, 200 µg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 µg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 µg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 µg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (n = 50), African-Americans (n = 29), and Taiwanese (n = 40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (n = 37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (p = 0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (p = 0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (p = 0.022, p = 0.049, and p = 0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (p = 0.64, p = 0.40, and p = 0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (p = 0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (n = 29) and Caucasian (n = 50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis. 
3||Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30), JAK2 mutation–negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18), or JAK2 mutation–negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous, copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF, but were absent in PV. In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML, myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired, transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related, clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory parameters, the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (MF), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition, several atypical MPNs are recognized, some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features, such as atypical, BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired, activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases, abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV, ET, and MF,5⇓⇓–8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg, MPL) or downstream (eg, NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9,10; however, the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes, one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11,12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV, it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies, and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and, if so, whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung (RZPD, Berlin, Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software, analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall, a median of 98.2% (range, 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, St Neots, United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5′-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3′) and CBL_i8r (5′-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3′) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5′-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3′) and CBL_i9r (5′-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3′). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamer–reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5′-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3′ and CBLe10R 5′-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3′. Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL, respectively, along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMV–HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3–dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen, Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI, 50% DMEM, 10% FBS, 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Stanford, CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting, the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3, vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 μg pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed, serum deprived overnight, exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes, and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 μL) were added and incubated at 4°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CBL (2111C3a; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30), V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18), and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators, we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30, of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie, < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly, we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast, aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total, 7 different chromosomes were affected, with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)−2 as determined by CNAT, with values approaching or exceeding −1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie, 20 indicates 10−20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line), but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5, a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample.

Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired, in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes, consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1, respectively; however, these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next, we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling, we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET, EPHA1, and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly, we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF, a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q, and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components, CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results, the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent, presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations, we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477, respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients, of whom 3 had MF, 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified, CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly, no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31), however, failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants, 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions), 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities, and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by ▼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions, FLT3 ITD, activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2, with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years, corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

(C) Clinical course of case UPN 14, who presented with MF in 1998 but experienced elevated leukocyte counts in 2005, concomitant with the appearance of the CBL L380P mutation. The JAK2 V617F mutation, which had been present at low level since diagnosis, was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample, when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR, sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D), similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely, therefore, that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases, 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity, including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis, 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant, UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear, but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in “Experimental procedures.” Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (□) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations, restricting the analysis to cases with aCML, MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution, age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)–dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3, as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F, H398Y, P417A, and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells, but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast, wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming, indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen, as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis, FLT3 was immunoprecipitated, blotted, and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that, upon ligand stimulation, FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F, H398Y, P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases, we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD, constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity, however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML, but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations, plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML, indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However, we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q, we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%), MF (n = 3, 6%), CMML (n = 10, 13%), or HES/CEL (n = 1, 1%); that is, morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern, however, any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role, CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues, a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21,24,25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl, the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus, and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however, it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy, specifically occasional cases of AML.15,23,27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs, and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed, 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members, CBLB and CBLC, but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg, Y371, C381, H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity, as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the α-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied, we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells, consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably, this mutation was only weakly conserved between species, in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or, alternatively, may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation, this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease, indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32,33 It remains to be established, however, if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34,35 However, closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically, hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number, hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34,35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore, the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36,37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant, these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation, however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case, however, also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array, suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML,38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations, one of which inhibits differentiation, and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another, unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD, the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations, it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary, we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily “tyrosine kinopathies,” that is, diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets, the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  
4||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinase–binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a “Random” missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Å. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Å from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poisson–Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  ΔGbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  ΔΔGbind=ΔGbindmut-ΔGbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  ΔΔGbind=αΔΔEvdw+βΔΔGsolv+γΔSAmut+εΔΔGBM+λΔΔGFD+δ (3) Here ΔΔEvdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and ΔΔGsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. ΔSAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. ΔΔGBM and ΔΔGFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( ΔGfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( ΔGfoldWT).  ΔΔGfold=ΔGfoldmut-ΔGfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS-containing 200 μM sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabs®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 m at 4 °C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20μg of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 μg of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, ΔΔGfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the ΔΔGfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value ≪ 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the ΔΔGfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the ΔΔGfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value ≪ 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (ΔΔGfold) and binding (ΔΔGbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an α-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value ≪ 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value ≪ 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal mol−1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (“Hetero”) and 27 homozygous (“Homo”) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 – 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 – 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (ΔΔGfold kcal mol−1), binding affinity (ΔΔGbind kcal mol−1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and ΔΔGfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of ΔΔGfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30–33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEAN’s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between ΔΔGfold and ΔΔGbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 – 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  
5||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinase–binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a “Random” missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Å. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Å from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poisson–Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  ΔGbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  ΔΔGbind=ΔGbindmut-ΔGbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  ΔΔGbind=αΔΔEvdw+βΔΔGsolv+γΔSAmut+εΔΔGBM+λΔΔGFD+δ (3) Here ΔΔEvdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and ΔΔGsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. ΔSAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. ΔΔGBM and ΔΔGFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( ΔGfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( ΔGfoldWT).  ΔΔGfold=ΔGfoldmut-ΔGfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS-containing 200 μM sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabs®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 m at 4 °C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20μg of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 μg of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, ΔΔGfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the ΔΔGfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value ≪ 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the ΔΔGfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the ΔΔGfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value ≪ 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (ΔΔGfold) and binding (ΔΔGbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an α-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value ≪ 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value ≪ 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal mol−1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (“Hetero”) and 27 homozygous (“Homo”) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 – 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 – 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (ΔΔGfold kcal mol−1), binding affinity (ΔΔGbind kcal mol−1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and ΔΔGfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of ΔΔGfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).

There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30–33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEAN’s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between ΔΔGfold and ΔΔGbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 – 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.
